          Flexible rewards programs let one credit card earn points that can be used for travel, cashback, gift cards and sometimes transfers to partners. This page explains how ThankYou-style points systems work and what to compare before choosing a rewards card.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a ThankYou-Style Rewards Program?</h2>
      <p>A ThankYou-style program is a flexible points ecosystem built around one or more credit cards. Instead of earning airline miles or hotel points directly, you earn a bank-controlled currency that can be redeemed in several ways: cash equivalents, statement credits, travel bookings, gift cards or transfers to external partners.</p>
      <p>The core idea is flexibility. You earn a single type of point from different cards and categories, then decide later how to use them. That makes it easier to adapt your rewards strategy when your travel or spending patterns change over time.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning Points -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How Spending Converts Into ThankYou-Style Points</h2>
      <p>Most flexible rewards cards use tiered earning structures. Everyday purchases might earn a base rate, while bonus categories like dining, groceries, online shopping or travel earn extra points per unit of spend. Some premium cards layer on elevated multipliers for specific lifestyle categories.</p>
      <p>New-card bonuses are common. If you reach a minimum spend within a promotional window, you receive a lump sum of points that can be worth a substantial amount when redeemed intelligently. Ongoing relationship bonuses and anniversary bonuses may also exist on certain card tiers.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming & Value -->
    <section id="redeeming" class="section">
      <h2>Redemption Options and What Affects Point Value</h2>
      <p>Flexible rewards programs typically support multiple redemption routes: cash or statement credits, travel booked through a portal, gift cards, merchandise and sometimes transfers to external travel partners. Each path usually has a different effective value per point.</p>
      <p>Portal bookings and partner transfers can sometimes increase the value of each point, while merchandise or low-value gift cards may reduce it. To judge real value, compare how many points are required against the cash price of the same booking or item.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Extra section: Transfers & Partner Use -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Transfers, Partners and Advanced Reward Strategies</h2>
      <p>When a program allows transfers to airline or hotel partners, points become a bridge between bank currency and travel-specific currencies. This can unlock high-value redemptions like long-haul business-class flights, but it also introduces complexity: award availability, partner charts and fuel surcharges all come into play.</p>
      <p>Because transfers are often one-way, it’s important to check that the trip or redemption you want is actually available before moving points. Once transferred, they are governed by the partner program’s expiry rules and restrictions instead of the original bank’s terms.</p>
